Deployed it : https://super-haupia-c1f121.netlify.app/

Had to move some hrefs to match the deployment links, mainly with the header tabs and CSS. 
The deployed version looks a little more zoomed in than the live host. 

Going to continue to add features and create a database to deploy it for user use. 

Currently working on user Log in and Sign up with respective databases.
