Deployed it : https://super-haupia-c1f121.netlify.app/

Had to move some hrefs to match the deployment links, mainly with the header tabs and CSS. 
Looking for new way to deploy it so that it actually is the same as the live server. 


Going to continue to add features and create a database to deploy it for user use. 

Currently working on user Log in and Sign up with respective databases.
